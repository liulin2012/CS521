true,then the sender send the packet 1 and then time out,then the sender resend the packets 1.
The receiver reveive the packet 1 and then send back a ack.Then the reveiver receive the packet 1 again and resend the ack
when the sender receive the first ack,it put the windows plus 1,so the 1 is not in the window,but then it receive anther packet 1 from his resend packet

true,same to first

true,the SR and GBD protocal are same then the window size is 1

true

When the application need to send the message.The TCP will cut the data to several segment based on the MSS.On the other hand the UDP encapsulates the data in one segment and then send it to the network.So the application can have more control what data is ent in a segment

The TCP has the flow control and congestion control so when the application send the data to the tcp,there are may be delay due to the control.but the udp doesn't have this restriction

###p26
$2^{32}$
The data need to be cut in $2^{32}/536=8012999$
so the whole data is $2^{32}+8012999*66=4823825230$ bytes
the time is $4823825230*8/1000/1000/155=249 sec$

Since the link speed is 100Mbps,but the host A application data speed is 120Mbps,so the host A send buffer will be full
The host B can only read out of TCP receive buffer at maximum rate of 50 Mbps,so the reveive buffer will also be full
When the host B receive buffer full,it will send the RecWindows=0 to the host A,then host A know host B is full so will stop send the data
When host B has executed some data from the buffer,so the Recwindos has some space,it will send the Recwindows>0 to the host A
Host A then begein to send the data until receive the Recwindos is 0
The process will repeat again and again.
