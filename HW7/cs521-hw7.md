###Question

What is the subnet address?
Dest: 200.45.34.56
Subnet: 255.255.240.0

What is the subnet address?
Dest: 19.30.80.5
Subnet: 255.255.192.0

Comparision between default mask and subnet mask:
class B default mask: 255.255.0.0
subnet mask: 255.255.240.0

###Answer

the subnet address is 200.45.32/20
the subnet address is 19.30.64/18
the default mask is used to mask the different ip class address such as class A ip,class B ip.
the subnet mask is used to mask the subnet in a same network.The network administrator can control the subnet allocation to different use.

a)The VC is connection-oriented network,so if the routers fail the reserve route path will not work anymore.So the source and destination need to bulid another path.
On the other hand,the datagram architecture is a connectionless network,so it is unnecessary to rebuild the path.The router will update the routing table.
so the datagram architecture will be in favor of.

b)VC is preferable because if the source and destination requires the fixed amount of capacity.VC is connection-oriented network so it can reserve the path to guarantee the capacity.

c)the datagram architecture have more control traffic overhead because it need to route through the network.The VC network will not change if it has been setted up.

###p2

a) 256

b) The central node will pick the free VC number between the 0 ~ 255.It is no possible that there are fewer VCs in progress than the maximum

c) Each node determine the VC number fron 0 to 255.In each router the VC number will be replaced from the arriving packet vc number to the outbound link vc number.

###p5

a) no vc number

b) 16

###p6

connection-oriented service means the end system maintain the state but the route don't konw that.The TCP maintain the state on both end system
The connection service means there are end-to-end system.The connection state maintain in each router along the path.

other                         3

match the other,to the interface 3
match the 1110000 ,to the interface 2
match the 11100001 1,the the interface 3

###p11

range
00000000 ~ 00111111 for interface 0,number is 64
01000000 ~ 01011111 for interface 1 number is 32
01100000 ~ 10111111 for interface 2,number is 96
11000000 ~ 11111111 for interface 3,number is 64
