Because if one wireless station has a large frames to transit.it will control the channel all the time if it begin the step 1 after it successfully transmit the frame.
But if it begin the step 2 after transmitiing a frame then it will choose a randon backoff, so it is fair to other wireless station to use the channel.so the fairness is the rationale.

###p7
the frame without the data is 32 bytes long.so the control frame is 32*8bits / 11Mbps = 23uses.The data frame time is (8000+256)bits/11Mbps = 751 usec
so total time is DIFS+RTS+SIFS+CTS+SIFS+DATA+SIFS+ACK = DIFS + 3SIFS + 820 usec

###p15
yes.Althought coa is same ,their permanent address is not same.So when the foreign agent receive the datagram ,it will decapsulate the datagram and determine the address of mobile .so seperate address will be used to send the data to the seperate destinations in the network.

###p16
The MSRN will be updated in the HLR when the MSRN changes.Each handoff requires the MSRN change,so the change is so frequent. 
The advantage is the MSRN will be privided quickly if the MSRN is in the HLR.it will not need to query the VLR.
