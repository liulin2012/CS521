 a,b,s  |source port|destination port
-----|-----------|------------
a->s|476|23
b>s|478|23
s->a|23|476
s->b|23|478

yes

no

###p2

b->a:source port:80,dest port 26145,source ip = b,det ip address = a
b->c,left:source port:80,dest port 26145,source ip = b,det ip address = c
b->c,right:source port:80,dest port 7532,source ip = b,det ip address = c

add four word,if one of the digits is zero,there are an error
all 1-bit complemment will be detected.
some 2-bit error will be undetected.

###p5

no.
because if two digits had been corrupted in the same positon of the two word.one is from 1 to 0,and another from 0 to 1.so the sum is alse same but there are 2-bit error occur.

###p8

the rdt3.0 receiver side is same to the rdt2.2

###p10

when the sender send a packat,start the timer,when the sender receive an ack,end the timer

add the timeout event on the "wait for ACK or NAK 0" and "wait for ACK or NAK 1".If the timeout occur,the sender side retransmitted the packet.

###p11

It will be correct if the action were removed from the wait-for-1-from-below because the sndpkt has been created before,so udt_send can still send the correct packet

no,it will not be correct if the action were removed from the wait-for-0-from-below because if the first sender-to-receiver packet were corrupted,there are no sndpkt created before,so there are an error occur.

###p12

It will be still work
