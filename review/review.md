Supposethatthelinksandroutersinthenetworkneverfailandthatrout- ing paths used between all source/destination pairs remains constant. In this scenario, does a VC or datagram architecture have more control traf- fic overhead? Why?

the datagram architecture have more control traffic overhead because it need to route through the network.The VC network will not change if it has been setted up.
